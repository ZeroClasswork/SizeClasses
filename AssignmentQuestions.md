## Assignment Questions
### Why do you think we needed to change our initial setup and add more stack views?
In order to use variations based on size, there needs to be some type of container view, not just the views themselves, that can have alterations, like horizontal layout instead of vertical.
### Why do we care to change the layout in landscape mode, when the original stack view changed by itself and we could still see the 4 colors?
It's not about the colors, it's about the content that might be stretched or unnatural to read in that view!
### Is it always required to use size classes? What is a good criteria to know if we should use them or not?
If making an app with portrait and landscape modes, and any content could look better formatted differently in both orientations, it's better to us size classes like in this example.
